# User Evaluation - Analysis
#### May 07, 2019

After completing all tasks declared on the VR application, participants were asked a few open questions which served as the four metrics of success of the tool’s usability: when asked if they understood more in depth human ear perception limitations, the majority revealed an discontent in the lack of exposure to the intricacies of audio programming and simulation of 360 sound. Also, there was an overall satisfaction with the mutability of ‘reality’, when given the possibility to influence the environment and enhance perceptual differences. Users understood that the scene that they created was not realistic, yet they could identify the modifications applied. Consequently, the ability to explore and apply different textures in real-time through the RA SDK influenced positively on their ability to highly absorbent from highly reflective material coefficients. And this was proven by the questionnaire’s answers to the first two questions. 

After analysing the registered results from the experiment, improvements and changes were made to the application. Although minor changes, the received user feedback substantially improved the current iteration of the application.
Playback functionality was added to each sub-menu in the application: users are able to playback again the sound recordings that act as introductory scripts to the different layers of sound spatialisation. Also, a ‘how-to’ menu was added to support the informational asset of the tool and the scripts that introduce the sub-menus in ‘Learn Menu’ were re-written, emphasising the theoretical aspects of Occlusion, Directivity Patterns and also Late Reflections.
