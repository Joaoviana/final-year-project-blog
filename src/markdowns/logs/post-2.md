# Virtual Reality and sound
#### January 17, 2019

The aim of Virtual Reality experiences is to create an alternate reality, but without the right audio perceptual cues to match the visuals, users do not buy into the illusion.  

Now that the user can use Virtual Reality headsets to explore a VR scene, there is a necessity to succeed by having immersive graphics combined with equally immersive 3D audio that replicates the natural listening experience.

Virtual Reality development is mostly done by creating applications with polished graphics, and a high sense of presence. The resulted applications would be required to be downloaded and installed in order to be used on a VR device. In order to keep up with the rapid growth of VRâ€™s market, there is a urgent need to widen the already existing web content to more specialised and sophisticated web-based platforms.

### The solution to this is WebVR

By integrating VR with modern web development technologies and practices the user would be able to reach the finished deployed application by simply accessing a provided URL. Since the data and code would be stored in the cloud, the developer/developers can make numerous improvements and deploy further iterations of the web application in rapid manner. HTML5 and one of the most popular programming languages JavaScript, are the part of the core tech stack that is used when developing in this environment. Also, another advantage of this practice is cross-platform: HTML5 and JavaScript can be run by any browser/device, making it easier to add extra layers on the code so that certain subtleties that one might encounter can be easily solved without making things too cumbersome. 


### What about the sound? 
The Web Audio API was built by W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium. Right after the addition of the HTML5 element < audio >, which would enable people to add audio stream playback to their applications, it was concluded that it still was not enough of a feature when there are so many capabilities in sound design available to us through other development environments aside from the Web. When the Web Audio API came into play, it gave the possibility for users to automate audio parameters, to process audio sources with modern spatialisation and artificial reverberation techniques. 

### What does that mean for WebVR development?

A modern solution for adding stable 360 sound rendering in WebVR while using the Web Audio API is the Resonance Audio SDK made by Google. The next log will cover this.

What technologies to use 

Understand exactly what I want to show to the user 

Immersive experiences do not necessarily mean that they have to be super realistic; Find ways to enhance those perceptual cues and ramp up reality!
