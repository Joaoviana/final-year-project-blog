# Resonance Audio SDK
#### Feburary 08, 2019

The Resonance Audio SDK, an open-source C++ library initially developed by Google, will aid my development process with a high-fidelity, spatial audio SDK, which delivers powerful and realistic methods that simulates how the human ear perceives sound and how the environment influences the same process. 

The SDK provides high order Ambisonics, which is a technology that embeds the user into a sound sphere and provides high spatial resolution, with more channels to provide more different polar patterns. Also, it allows HRTFs to be applied just once to the field, instead of assigning them to individual sound sources. The optimisation of this model is computationally cheap, allowing multiple sound sources, a definitely great quality of this resource. 

### How is the sound projection? 

RA delivers this almost perfect projection of sound by following two directives of sound wave simulation: 

-	Interaction with human ears, by measuring, as previously mentioned, ITDs, ILDs, spectral effects – sound waves reflect from the inside of our outer ears in different directions – and HRTFs.
-	Interaction with the environment, by head tracking technologies that capture their movements and the position of the sound source; And by acknowledging direct sound between the listener and source; then the existence of early reflections, which arrive our ears in the very beginning, giving us a sense of the dimensions and overall shape of the room; and finally the late reverb, which, is defined by the increase of density of reflections that arrive at both of our ears until it their sound waves attenuate. 


### Cross-browser compatibility? How can I use it? 

It is supported by all browsers available and users can use this SDK in various gaming, audio and web development tools, such as Web, Android and iOS, Unity and Unreal.


### Performance

Resonance Audio provides with advanced sound design features, cross-platform support and high-resolution performance for both desktop and mobile devices. It allows the developer to utilise their optimized signal processing algorithms on hundreds of sound sources without compromising audio quality. By incorporating all sound sources in a global Ambisonic sound filed, HRTFs are applied just once globally, rather than jeopardizing large CPU costs per sound source.
